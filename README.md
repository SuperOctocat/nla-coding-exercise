# nla-coding-exercise
This is a sample web application to view the users and books in a library.
It can display the list of users and the list of books available.
It can also show what books the user has borrowed from the library.
  


This is implemented using only a single page html which dynamically rewrites the page using these technologies:
- Java 11
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- VueJs (in index.js)
- ECMAScript 6 (in main.js)
- Bootstrap
- H2 in-memory DB

To run:
1. Clone the code from github.
2. In Terminal or cmd, go to the root folder e.g. nla-coding-exercise.
3. Type 'mvn spring-boot:run' from the commandline to run it out of the box.
4. Open a browser and enter 'http://localhost:8080' to go to the home page.
Press 'Ctrl + C' to stop running the app.

Have fun!
